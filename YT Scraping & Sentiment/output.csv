,This is the best documentary Ad for a jacket i've ever watched! GG to the climbers and sherpas!
,I'm cold just watching this. Scary. 🥶😨
,Wish they'd talk about and show the descent. Did they sleep at camp 2 or just powered all the way down?
murdo182,"It’s kind of sad that the majority of people don’t realise Nimsdai Purja and team fixed the rope and led the trail blaze to the summit prior to the team in this documentary going for the summit, they literally waited for the work to be done and didn’t give any credit or a mention at all in this film"

Liftnd,Sherpa be like $2 more than I make in the sweatshop sewing for Eddie Bauer
Vishwa,@15:43 seriously? for 7 days trek in such hostile conditions with huge luggage on their back they were paid just $2? A coffee in Starbucks costs at least $4. This is seriously an inhumane way of exploiting poor people who take a huge risk for other's luxury.
Hk 4lyfe,"The nice thing about K2 is that unlike Everest, it scares away all the casuals, thus preserving its prestige."
Safar and Travel,"These people pay $ 50K expedition fee plus equipments for another $ 50K to $ 100K. What they do not want to pay is porter fee who actually enables them to reach to K2. Those poor people have only 2 months of earning in a year, when expeditions start. Still after travelling to this far, these climbers do not want them to pay atleast $ 50. What a shame."

So, the anxiety makes me sick, and when you add that with beans going bad and half the group coming down sick, It's not good. Definitley relate to being sick while in the backcountry"

banmadabon,So Basically they pull their self up on ropes installed by Sherpa...
Jonathan Stewart,"Brings back memories. I was there in 2001, did the trek over Gondoro La, hiking along with K2 and Broad Peak and Gasherbrum climbers.  With as many climbers as 2019, I can imagine the porter situation was a shit show (literally and figuratively). But it's nothing new. Porter revolts are a yearly event, coming as no surprise to anyone. Smaller trips, like mine, bring in trustworthy porters from Skardu, pay them double, and don't worry about being left holding your bags. But you can't do that with a large expedition. But even when I was there two decades ago, K2 had already begun its inevitable march towards Everest-like commercialization. Not mentioned in this video is how all of those static lines are set in advance for our heroes to climb for the video."
A1MYT MCOC,As usual...the locals are exploited and never given credit!
Andrew Gackenbach,"Loved it, but would've appreciate a special acknowledgement or something for Nims, highly doubt there is a summit without him and his team."

jage,U R walking up the length of 8 New York Empire State Buildings. I'd rather sit here in my warm comfy chair drinking tea. Beautiful footage. Fantastic SHERPAS💞
M. D.,"As many mentioned, this push to the top would have been impossible without the help of Nirmal Purja and his team, who made the track in the thick snow before Adrian's team.

It still is an incredible accomplishment without ox', but it would have been fair to mention Nims effort and the fact that it wouldn't have been done without it."
The DreemChaser,Beyond an amazing feat! Definitely on my bucket list 🙏🏼
Tamara Tserennyam,"So cool , challenging  and adventurer , thank you , brave people , Carla is so precious"

Pankaj Banne,I see... So this is how the heaven looks like
Casey and Breelyn,"I'm still mad at how under appreciated Sherpas are. They literally do ALL the work and never get credit. These ""mountaineers"" that go and attempt these mountains stand on the back of all these sherpas. Sherpas make the camps, place rope, carry gear etc. all the regular climbers do is follow the ropes up...."
Juan Valencia,Soooo sick 😎🤩 much respect go Ecuador 🇪🇨
James Hoad,It was tough work to get up the stairs just to put my phone on charge so I I could watch this whole video in my bedroom! I'm glad I made it!

cs chaka,BREATHTAKING !!
Gary Kramer,"This was an amazing documentary. It was also an amazing feat to do this without oxygen. I’m just disappointed there was no mention of Nimsdai and his team being an integral part of the summit push. I remember seeing him post about clearing the way past the bottleneck. It absolutely would not have taken anything away from the amazing feat that the Eddie Bauer team accomplished. It just would’ve been a bit more honest to include appreciation for how they helped. Adrian even mentioned that on an Instagram post during the expedition. Still though, congrats on doing something so amazing and capturing it so well."

Frank Brown,"Epic challenge and great, inspiring  documentary : congratulations!"

Cheesus,"Due to a genetic problem, my body naturally produces too many red blood cells. At rest, I have about the same values as an acclimated climber. This causes me some health problems, but if I wanted to go to K2 I could push for the summit from day one😂"

Kisan B.k,Salut xa nepali teams lai
Sebastian Szczepaniak,"I haven't seen such a well documented climb in a long time. Of course, it's also due to the current technology Mallory, Herzog, Buhl, Hillary or Messner just didn't have a small GoPro or similar cameras at the time... The details of the mountain, with the steep slopes, the Seracs and the dimensions themselves are simply incredible! You feel like you are on the mountain yourself. "
Tim Anderson,"At first I thought dude, don't you have a job . But as I watched I really admired that dude and then the rest of them. I'm happy they made the K2."
Johnny Johnny,"No offense to anyone, but I'm glad I never got bit by the mountain climbing bug lol"
Tony Morisco,"Well done, I could feel their pain as if I was there. Have done difficult things in my life time but never anything approaching this climb, I respect the drive that each one of them had to accomplish K2. The porters deserve as much credit as the rest of the team, they were the foundation that the climb was built on.  Outstanding accomplishment!"
D Heath,Imagine the bad morning breaths in the tent

Rix Gaming,Film ended on the summit. Makes you wonder what happened on the way down for them to not show any of it.
A G,"Cool! Looks just like Everest but Everest is obviously a bit harder since it's higher. I climbed Everest(YES, I'M ONE OF THE FEW :DDDDD) so I guess there's no point in climbing K2. Gonna be bored probably. lol."

Yohanan Arjoon,"These people talk big but,
